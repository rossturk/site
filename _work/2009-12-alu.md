### About Alcatel-Lucent

Alcatel-Lucent provided products and innovations in IP and cloud networking, as well as ultra-broadband fixed and wireless access. I worked in the Applications Enablement team, where our goal was to increase the value of carrier networks by exposing advanced capabilities to developers.

### Responsibilities

I managed a global team of developer evangelists and community managers, represented Alcatel-Lucent to the global technology community, and managed the creation of new developer community tools.

### Accomplishments

* Launched the Open API Service website and platform, exposing powerful network APIs to developers
* Supervised the creation of prototype applications and sample code to inspire creativity
* Ran multiple hackathons and events at conferences around the world
* Evangelized the potential of the network, appealing to developers who were accustomed to building applications “over the top”
* Performed keynote-level speaking engagements about the power of advanced network capabilities
