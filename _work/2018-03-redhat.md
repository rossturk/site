### About Red Hat

Red Hat is the world’s premier open source company, providing enterprise subscriptions for Linux, middleware, cloud platforms, and software-defined storage.

### Responsibilities

I led a team of architects responsible for codifying solutions that combine multiple parts of the Red Hat portfolio, with an emphasis on diagramming and other visual communication.

I provided executive leadership for our emerging technologies marketing team, responsible for implementing go-to-market strategy for artificial intelligence / machine learning, blockchain, serverless computing, microservices, and IoT.

I provided content and expertise for global marketing campaigns, bringing a technical reality to our go-to-market motions.

I communicated our strategy to industry analysts through briefings, roundtables, and written documentation.
I was the “go-to” designer for our department, called upon when they couldn’t wait for a dedicated design resource.
