### About JWT Specialized Communications

JWT Specialized Communications is a subsidiary of J. Walter Thompson, providing agency services for mature markets, recruitment advertising, employment branding, and other targeted audiences.

### Responsibilities

I performed administration of Internet servers and developed software to facilitate new offerings and increase operational efficiency. I was the primary owner of all internal and external web, DNS, mail, and print servers running Linux and Windows NT.

### Accomplishments

* Developed a PHP application for rapid review and approval of ad content

* Built a change control system for validating and publishing website content

* Wrote a series of scripts for managing and de-duplicating an online resume database, reducing the import cycle from two hours to twenty minutes
