### About ENGAGE games online

ENGAGE, a subsidiary of Interplay Entertainment, created online gaming experiences for users of AOL and the early Internet. By extending the multiplayer capabilities of titles in Interplayâ€™s extensive catalog, ENGAGE created online gaming experiences well ahead of their time.

### Responsibilities

I performed Unix system administration for web, DNS, and game servers, and developed scripts for monitoring, automation, reporting, and deployment. I wore a pager, and worked diligently to make sure it never went off. I wrote hundreds of pages of documentation on system operations.
