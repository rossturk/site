Ever been on a plane, coming in for a landing, when suddenly something changes?  You hear the whirring noise of control surfaces moving and engines revving back up. You might get that wibbly feeling in the pit of your stomach as g-forces switch polarity. You’re suddenly taking off again. 

This happens because something wasn’t right. Maybe there was another plane on your runway. Maybe there was a sudden crosswind or windshear. Some might think it’s terrifying, but I fly all the time…so please for the love of god make something different happen every so often. I choose instead to find this exciting.

Anyway, this *exciting* event is called a “go-around” or a “missed approach”. Every pilot has a plan for a go-around. There is a checklist, and they have it memorized. When millions of dollars and hundreds of lives are at stake, it’s good to have a plan B.

Actually, a lot of pilots consider going-around to be plan A and landing to be plan B, just to stay sharp. The red line in this approach procedure shows what you are supposed to do if you can’t land. It’s common enough you don’t even need permission to do it, you just do it. 

Many airline pilots began their flying careers as military pilots. Fighter pilots train at the Air Force Academy, just north of Colorado Springs. It’s a gorgeous place, and it’s a safe place to fly - lots of flat prairie land without a ton of development. It is also one of the busiest airfields in the world. 

As a child, I would pass by on the way to visit my grandparents. You couldn’t see much from I-5, but I’d stare out of the window into the prairie expecting Maverick and Goose to rocket by at any moment. I never saw any planes, but I did fail to appreciate the breathtaking view of the Rockies.

I have a passion for airfields. There’s something about long, square stretches of concrete that I find aesthetically pleasing. And I love diagrams of them! They are really great examples of good visual communication, making tons of information available at a glance. I like everything you can learn from them.

This airport, at the academy, is particularly interesting. I spend a lot of time looking at it. Let’s just enjoy it for a moment. Ahhh. See how the straight stretches of concrete intersect at all these delightfully deliberate angles? See the way they paint them with all those neat numbers and shapes?

Most Air Force bases look like this - a 10,000 foot runway, or sometimes two, at about 200 feet wide. Which makes sense because they are used by very powerful, concrete-hungry aircraft. But you may have noticed that this doesn’t look like the airfield at the academy.

It has a whole bunch of very short runways. I mean, look at them! They are less than 5000 feet long. That’s really short for a military airfield. And they are especially narrow - 75 feet wide. This is a super charming airfield, but wouldn’t you expect an Air Force academy to be more like an Air Force base?

The reason is that they learn to fly on gliders. Gliders are small one or two-person crafts that have no engines and are designed to stay in the air as long as possible without them. They don’t require long runways, neither do their tow planes. The Air Force Academy field is perfect for tons of gliders: lots of small runways and tons of space for parking.

But *why* do they train in gliders? First, they are simpler to operate - no engines to start, no oil to check. That gets rid of a lot of steps and lets ya focus on the task of flying. Second, their maneuverability makes it easy to correct mistakes. Third, they are cheap. That means when a student pilot screws up, it doesn’t cost millions of dollars. 

These are all great reasons, but I think the most interesting one is this: as soon as your tow plane disconnects, a clock starts ticking. Once you lose a certain amount of altitude and a certain amount of speed, you are landing. There is no missed approach, no go-around. There is no way out. You have to *land the plane*.

But they are also safer. Since they have no engines, they weigh nothing. On the ground, you pull them around with a rope like a big dog. They don’t travel at particularly high speeds. More to the point, they are proportionally very strong for their weight. But what increases safety more than anything: no engine means no gas, no fire. A glider crash is usually survivable. 

They stack the odds as much as they can to increase the likelihood of success and reduce the consequences of failure. But every approach counts. Every flight puts students in a do or die situation. Or, at least, a “do or end up in a field and wait in shame for someone to bring a truck out to get you” situation.

That is the way aviators think. Big plane filled with flammable liquid and hundreds of humans, costing millions of dollars? You should plan for failure. Glorified paper airplane carrying one person over nice, fluffy prairies filled with blue columbine and gophers? Land the fucking plane and don’t give yourself the indulgence of another option.

But sometimes something else happens. This is a piece of a 767 that ran out of fuel while flying between Montreal and Edmonton. Air Canada had just transitioned from imperial to metric, the fuel quantity indicator system was broken, and *multiple people* calculated wrong by hand. They added 5,000 liters of fuel when they needed to add 20,000. Whoops.

After the engines stopped, they were forced to land at a closed military airfield that had been converted into a race track. There’s no plan for landing a 767 that suddenly *becomes* a glider. The crew - who trained in gliders - were heroes at everything except math. They landed their plane, even if it’s not how they intended to.

I spend a lot of time reading analysis of accidents like this - I am fascinated at how much has to actually go wrong for a plane to crash. It’s almost never just a single error. When there is a lot at stake, it is a combination of a whole bunch of separate failures and mistakes that work in concert, making a go-around impossible.

There is nothing left from the planes that don’t make it, so I keep a little piece of this plane as a reminder. I believe in doing everything you can to mitigate the consequences of failure. I believe in working to increase the chances of success. But sometimes you find yourself painted into a corner anyway, and - in those times - it pays to have plenty of practice landing the plane.
